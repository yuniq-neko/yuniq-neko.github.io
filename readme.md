# I'm afraid there's nothing too glamorous to see here!

This repo contains the inner workings of my personal website at [yuniq-neko.github.io](https://yuniq-neko.github.io/).

A fair majority of these files were automatically generated using Jekyll, and those files that weren't... being the posts I create... are quite sparse... 😁
